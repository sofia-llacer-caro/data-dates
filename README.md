# Movie Database Management System

Welcome to the Movie Database Management System repository. This system is designed to manage information about movies, directors, and their connections, as well as to calculate movie ratings based on different sources. The database is created using SQL and PostgreSQL, with functionality to add and update movie data.

## Introduction

This repository contains SQL code for a movie database management system. The system is developed by Rubén Cerdà-Bacete and Sofia Llàcer Caro as an introductory project to databases in SQL. It allows you to manage information about movies, directors, and their connections in a PostgreSQL database. You can also calculate movie ratings based on different sources and user input.

## SQL Schema

The SQL schema in this repository defines the structure of the database. It includes tables for movies, directors, and their relationships. There is also a trigger function to calculate the average movie rating. The schema helps organize the data and ensure data integrity.

## Usage

To use this system, you need to set up a PostgreSQL database and run the SQL scripts provided. The repository includes two sets of scripts:
1. SQL schema setup: This script creates the necessary tables and schema for the database. You should execute this script first to initialize the database structure.
2. Sample data insertion: These scripts insert sample data into the database for testing and demonstration purposes. The data includes movies, directors, and their relationships.

To get started, follow these steps:
1. Create a PostgreSQL database.
2. Run the SQL schema setup script to create the required tables and schema.
3. Run the sample data insertion scripts to populate the database with sample data.

Please note that this system is intended for educational purposes and can be further extended for more advanced movie database management.
